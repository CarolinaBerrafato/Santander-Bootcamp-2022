# <span style = "color: #A61B1B">Santander Bootcamp 2022</span>

This repository has my course progress in Santander Bootcamp 2022 in **Fullstack Track**. Each module (except the 1st one) has two folders:
- Certificates: All certificates I've got in the module;
- Challenges: Code and project challenges in the module;

I created a page for this Bootcamp at Notion, so I could add notes while watching the classes. I'll add the link for each page in the following README sections as soon as I finish each course. I may also complement these notes soon with other helpful information on the internet.

The notes are written in Portuguese!

I've learned about computational thinking and Git/GitHub. The project challenge was creating a GitHub repository (I made this one!).

Hello! My name is Maria Carolina, but you can call me Carol. I'm a 19 years old girl from Brazil pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at CIn UFPE. I love challenging myself, so I decided to work on this project in English to practice! I'm only beginning my journey in technology, so there's much more to come! :heart:
